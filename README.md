# udd

Here is the distribution for "udd," a UNIX version of the classic [PDP-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11)/[VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX) [DND](http://www.digital-eel.com/files/dndpage_files/DND.htm) game.

I've fixed enough to get it working (in macOS anyway, ymmv).

Thanks to Chuck Cranor, the original author, for permission to share his code.

* Only works in 32-bit mode, 64-bit crashes (TODO: fix).

here is the distribution for "udd" a unix version of classic PDP-11/VAX
DND game.   See "VERSION" for the history.   This is version V5.1C-07.

HOW TO COMPILE:
 1. determine where the game is going to live.  by default it is set
    to run out of the current directory.  if you want to change that
    (e.g. have it look for its files in /usr/games/lib) edit the top
    section of defs.h (change FIL_*).

 2. if you want access to the operator program, edit swb_file.c swb_wiz().

 3. "make" --- current make files compiles with all debugging.  edit
    makefile to change this.  if you get compile errors on unix.c, try
    inverting the OLDTTY define in that file (default is now to use termios).

 4. run ./udd, it should go.

sorry there isn't more documentation (especially WRT the operator
program).
